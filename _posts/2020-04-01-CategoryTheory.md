For my final semester at [Colby College](http://colby.edu/) I am undertaking an independent study of Category Theory under [Professor Dale Skrien](https://cs.colby.edu/djskrien/). While this independent study began back in February, it has been a rather tumultuous first couple months - I have not dived head first into formal/abstract math in nearly two and a half years, so I experienced a Fred Flintsone-esque start (lot's of moving, not much progress). From there I nearly gave up, concluding I would *"just code some Haskell and call it a day"*. <br>
<br>
Well, after a couple weeks of pondering (*Shelter-in-place-Springbreak*), I have regained my na√Øve, enthusiastic desire to make some sense of this stuff. In the coming month and a half I will be blogging, attempting to translate the *bible*, [Categories for the Working Mathematician](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387984032), into common, layman language. If this is of interest, grab a coffee, lay down your bias against emojis and gifs in technical writing, and dive in!
