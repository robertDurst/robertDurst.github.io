title:  "[Category Theory Series] II: From Categories to Functors"

Welcome back! If you have not yet read the first post in this series, please do. These posts are cumulative and will continue to build on each other.

At the end of last post, we *concretafied* (made concrete) the ideas of a Category with the example of a newcomer to Seattle asking for directions to Starbucks. In this example one of the kind strangers *simplified* the map of Seattle roads, taking one map of the roads and translating it to another. Since each map may be considered its own *driving* category (with locations as objects and roads as arrows), this translation between categories, is in fact an example of a `Functor`, a function from one category to another. In the example, we applied a functor to simplify the diagram, allowing for the strangers to *see the map in a new light*... seems like `Functors` might be useful ü§î.

### Our World So Far  

In the last post, we constructed a *world* from scratch. In this world, there are `objects`, relationships or transitions between objects called `arrows`, four `operations` that allow us to `observe` properties of the world and two `axioms` or `truths` that allow us to `reason` about the world by building arguments that are provable.

**Arrows = Morphisms:** another name for an arrow is a morphism. We may use these names interchangeably.

### Categories Part 2

In the first post, we focused on building up to a Category. Since we have done so sufficiently, we will now dive a bit deeper into a couple additional features of Categories and introduce some of them by name.

#### A Formality

In order to simplify the first post in this series, I had to lie a bit. We did not really start from a *clean slate*. Instead, our Category Theory actually exists within the mathematical realm of [Set Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/).

Ok, stick with me, I will explain!

From the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/):

*"The axioms of set theory imply the existence of a set-theoretic universe so rich that all mathematical objects can be construed as sets. Also, the formal language of pure set theory allows one to formalize all mathematical notions and arguments. Thus, set theory has become the standard foundation for mathematics, as every mathematical object can be viewed as a set, and every theorem of mathematics can be logically deduced in the Predicate Calculus from the axioms of set theory."*

**TL&DR:** the axioms of set theory's axioms can serve well as the foundation for much of mathematics, including Catgegory Theory. Thus, besides the two axioms defined as part of a Category, we have ten more.

### Functor

As mentioned above, `functor`, `F`, is a morphism between `categories` - or a scheme for going from one world to another. In order to perform this morphism, we must translate all the arrows and all the objects into the new world. For a domain category `D` and a codomain category `C`, we do this by way of two functions:
* **object function (object)**: assigns each object of `D` to an object in `C`
* **arrow function (arrow)**: assigns each arrow in `D` to an arrow in `C`

Both of these functions must obey the following two rules:
1. for an object `d` in `D` that is assigned to `c` in `C`,<br>*arrow(`IDa`)* = `IDb`<br>This basically says that identities must be upheld.
2. for arrows `f` and `g` in `D`,<br>*arrow(`g ; f`)* = *arrow(`g`)* `;` *arrow(`f`)*<br>This basically says that composition must be upheld.

For specific examples, see `IDüçã` ‚û°Ô∏è `IDüçï` demonstrating the first rule and `g ; f` ‚û°Ô∏è `j ; i` demonstrating the second rule in the diagram below. *Note:* black arrows represent (*arrow*) while red arrows represent (*object*) for some functor `F: D ‚û°Ô∏è C`.

What is the importance of preserving identity and composition? Well, with these upheld we maintain the structure of the world after the morphism. Thus, the axioms continue to stand and we can continue to reason about the relationships between objects in a similar fashion.
