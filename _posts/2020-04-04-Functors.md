Welcome back! If you have not yet read the first post in this series, please do. These posts are cumulative and will continue to build on each other.

## Our World So Far  

In the last post, we constructed a *world* from scratch. In this world, there are `objects`, relationships or transitions between objects called `arrows`, four `operations` that allow us to `observe` properties of the world and two `axioms` or `truths` that allow us to `reason` about the world.

**Arrows = Morphisms:** another name for an arrow is a morphism. We may use these names interchangeably.

## Space Travel, Or Well, Morphisms Between Categories

### Philosophical Preface
Naturally, we humans tend to grasp for meaning by investigating the innards of things - *"don't judge a book by it's cover"* right? However, consider the basis of this principle. When judging something by its cover, or its structure, we make broad, generalized assumptions based on observations, and some fundamental/universal truths. Judging things based on a structure may not necessarily indicate its merit, yet it does allow for judgement based on an objects relationship with other objects. This idea, of describing things by `relationship to other things` instead of by `innards` is a core principle of Category Theory. Thus, when translating from one world to another, we seek to maintain the structure of the translated world to some degree, depending on the desired effect of the translation.<br>

### Functor

A `functor`, `F`, is a morphism between `categories` - or a scheme for going from one world to another. In order to perform this morphism, we must translate all the arrows and all the objects from some domain category `D` to some codomain category `C`. We do this by way of two functions:
* **object function (object)**: assigns each object of `D` to an object in `C`
* **arrow function (arrow)**: assigns each arrow in `D` to an arrow in `C`

Both of these functions must obey the following two rules:
1. for an object `d` in `D` that is assigned to `c` in `C`,<br>*arrow(`IDa`)* = `IDb`<br>This basically says that identities must be upheld.
2. for arrows `f` and `g` in `D`,<br>*arrow(`g ; f`)* = *arrow(`g`)* `;` *arrow(`f`)*<br>This basically says that composition must be upheld.

For specific examples, see `IDüçã` ‚û°Ô∏è `IDüçï` demonstrating the first rule and `g ; f` ‚û°Ô∏è `j ; i` demonstrating the second rule in the diagram below. *Note:* black arrows represent (*arrow*) while red arrows represent (*object*) for some functor `F: D ‚û°Ô∏è C`.

What is the importance of preserving identity and composition? Well, with these upheld we maintain the structure of the world after the morphism. Thus, the axioms continue to stand and we can continue to reason about the relationships between objects in a similar fashion.
