This was my first night with the [AWB Onesky](https://shop.astronomerswithoutborders.org/products/awb-onesky-reflector-telescope). Mostly used 8-24mm eye with 2x Barlow on sometimes. Tried many combos of T-adapter and DSLR to get camera working, no luck. Pretty intense light pollution and bright moon meant a suboptimal night.
