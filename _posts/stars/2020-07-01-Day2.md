Most incredible sky ever after moon went down. Saw Milkyway across sky from 3:20am - 4:05am.

Also my brother got a ok-ish picture of moon. Turns out if we adjust the length of the barrel of my AWB Onesky, we can decrease(?) the focal length. Will need to play around with this and the collmination later. My brother was unable to focus with these settings. Lots of failed observation attempts of various objects of interest.
