Damn moon near full and bright as hell - it is causing the orange glow above. Very small good viewing window (maybe 5 minutes) for seeing Milkway. Astrophotography not really possible to the extent my brother got last night. We tried to see a couple things but w/o my app (back in our car at the bottom of the hill) we had no luck. One plus for the day was I realized 7 sister == Pleaides! Also, we saw Venus. It was a crescent, which my brother explained led to some really interesting proof of some property of the universe many years ago.
