Goal of today was to end my streak of failed observations... not much success here. That being said, my brother and I were able to locate Sagitta which was within the realm of what we were looking for. I consider that a win.

Also, my brother took this cool picture with Joshua trees in the foreground. Believe it or not, it is pitch dark and the middle of the night!
