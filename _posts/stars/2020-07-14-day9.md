Quick viewing session today - windy and cold. My brother confirmed he also thinks we've located M51. I have found that it's easier to locate with my 25mm eyepiece. I also think I got close to the Eagle/Lagoon Nebulas. Certainly clusters of many, many stars. Going to wait until my nebula filter arrives to confirm.
