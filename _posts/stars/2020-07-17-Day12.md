In search of a good place to see NeoWise, my brother and I headed towards Morgan Territory. Unfortunately we weren't the only ones with the idea, so we couldn't find parking and had to turn back. Instead of returning home, we decided to stop on the side of the road and spend an hour looking at the *slightly* darker sky. Even just a slightly darker sky actually made N27 a bit greener through the Nebula Filter. Quite cool! We tried to take some pictures here as well, however due to the wind, cars flashing their lights at us every few minutes, and the precision control handles on my mount not quite functioning, we gave up. Still definitely a win on the night - seeing Nebulas is always incredibly fascinating!
