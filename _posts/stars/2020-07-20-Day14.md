Tonight was all about NeoWise! My brother and I finally saw it over the light polluted hills of Dublin. Turns out it was much higher in the sky than I expected (I guess I don't understand degrees above horizon that well yet) and fairly easy to find. While we couldn't quite see it with our naked eye, we almost could out of the corner of our eye once we knew where to look. Below are a couple images my brother snapped:
