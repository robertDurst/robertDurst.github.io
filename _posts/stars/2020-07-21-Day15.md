Saw NeoWise with the whole family. The relevation of today was that my father's binoculars are basically as good as my telescope with my 25mm. The only real difference is stability and of course that my Dob captures much more light. After viewing NeoWise for a bit, I called it early - it was my first cloudy night :(
