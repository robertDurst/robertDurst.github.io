RE: yesterday's post about lack of magnification of my telescope. I realized that since I've been utilizing my 25mm most of the time, I get 26x lol! So yes, at this magnification, my father's binoculars are in fact quite competitive. Once I get the 2x barlow and 10mm, I get up to 130x.

After checking out NeoWise (obligatory first observation, especially since today was supposed to be the bightest), I went down the usual list of "what's the easiest DSO to see".... today was all about double stars [thanks to this Cloudy Nights thread for inspiration](https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/272382-easiest-dsos-to-find/). 

### Alibiero Double Star

The coolest one of the night was definitely Albiero. Albiero is a bright orange star paired with a smaller blue one. To find it, I started with the right most side of Lyra's parallelogram (the one containing M57), went a tad bit right, then went straight down. It is quite hard to miss.

### Mizar and Alcor

You've probably seen this one... you just did not realize it. Alcor is the second-to-last star in the tail of Ursa Major. 

### Enif - Pendulum Star

I've actually been looking at this one quite a lot recently, as the landmark closest to M15. It turns out it is also a double star. More specifically, it is known as *Epsilon Pegasi* and is interesting because it is an example of the [Pulrich Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulfrich_effect). Basically, as better explained [here](https://pulfrich.siu.edu/Pulfrich_Pages/explains/expl_txt/explaint.html), there is an optical illusion where Enif appears to move in an osciallting pattern relative to its double.

### Some Random Pictures

First and foremost, I recently purchased a flexible, slow motion handle. While this is certainly an upgrade, I mainly purchased it because one of the plastic handles that came with my Vixen Porta II mount "broke". By "broke" I mean the tension pin inside it was lost - I thought some electrical tape would fix it, but I did not have any luck. Here is my setup with the new handle:

I also had some fun trying out the barlow with my lunar glow filter AND nebula filter on my 10mm eyepiece. This is the second time I have tried this... worked just as well as last time.

Finally, I am pretty sure I saw someone scrounging through what was either donations or giveaways of someones - a pile of old chairs and what not on the curb. It seemed a bit suspicious, but I did not feel like I should abandon my telescope and run after this guy. Here is an image of the person near his car.
