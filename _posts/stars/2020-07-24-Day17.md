Ok, so let me lay it out there, I have a VERY suboptimal AP (Astrophotography) setup. From my littel bit of research, I have come to believe a good AP setup consists of:
* equatorial mount
* tracking mount
* guiding camera
* color, cooled CCD
* high focal ratio telescope

I have:
* monochrome, not cooled planetary camera
* alt-azimuth mount
* manually guided mount
* F/5 focal ratio

However, if I get even remotely good images of anything (besides the moon of course) it will be a super satisfying win... plus this camera is actually super cool:

## [Target 1: Jupiter](#target-1-jupiter)

Looking back, I am not sure why I didn't first go for the moon * shrug *. Anyway, Jupiter actually came out pretty well. In the image below, the moons are clearly visible. It turns out after all the doubt that my Barlow is helpful and 2 weeks of being convinced it was a piece of crap (since I paid < $30 and got a Moon filter with it on Amazon) I actually was not able to focus until I attached it. You go $30 Barlow, you go! This image is stacked, with [AutoStakkert](https://www.autostakkert.com/). I do not really have much experience with stacking, nor have I done any reading since my moon stacking project in high school... so there is a lot of room for improvement here. In fact, I have done almost no reading on AP at all, so I like to believe I have a lot of potential for improvement here in general :)

## [Target 2: Moon](#target-2-moon)

After figuiring out I needed to focus, especially since I had tossed on the Barlow, I actually was able to see lots of craters in the moon - it was one of those this sh#t is awesome moments. Unfortunately my stacking skills are still very subpar... so my stacked image came out worse than just turning the AVI into a Gif. Here is the gif I came up with, thanks to [cloudconvert.com](https://cloudconvert.com/avi-to-gif).
