## Overview
Over the past four weeks, I have spents some time (and money... this is not the cheapest hobby) upgrading my AWB Onesky. I figuired it was time to do an inventory check and figuire out how deep I am into this hobby.

Well... not great, but not too bad considering I now have a very basic Astrophotography setup (AP is a notoriously expensive hobby, just Google). 

So what is the point of this post? I want to br upfront about what I bought and how much it is. I have read a few astro blogs and often you're left thinking wow that's so cool, how do I do what this guy is doing, and then you realize just a single piece in his setup is WAY out of your budget. So, I think this post should help people ballpark how deep I am in and if they want to go down a similar route, what they can expect to pay and what budget they can get to if they skip some items (i.e. build a tripod at home).
