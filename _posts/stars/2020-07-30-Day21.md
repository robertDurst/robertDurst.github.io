Today I switched things up and decided to check out the stars much later in the night. While I was not able to see Neptune or Uranus, my two targets, I was able to see mars and Pleiades showed itself. While I technically saw this for the first time in the dark sky of Death Valley, I did not check it out with the Nebula filter... so this is really the first viewing :)

While my goal was to process my footage of Albiero, I could not quite get everything aligned, so I checked out the footage from the previous night of Saturn. Still a long ways to go in terms of focus and processing... however it is still pretty cool!
