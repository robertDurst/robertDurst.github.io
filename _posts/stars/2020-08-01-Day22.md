# [Moon](#moon)

Today I experimented with how far out I could zoom. To really do this, I need a reducer. To attempt with my current equiptment, I put together as many of my adapters as I could to move the focal length of the telescope back and still have the focal point in a good place to pick up the moon. Here is my best attempt processed. Again, still need some work on my processing and focusing abilities. To get better, I will probably have to do a bit more than *Align - Limit - Stack*. For this I used Registax on 100 10ms images.
