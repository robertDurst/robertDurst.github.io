In the words of Lil Wayne, *"same old space new scope."*

Today was an exciting day!! I finally bit the bullet and purchased a [Go-To tracking Alt-Azimuth mount(Skywatcher AZ-GTI)](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/products/az-gti-mount) along with a faster (F10 or F/12) telescope - [Skywatcher Skymax 102mm Maksutov Cassegrain](https://www.highpointscientific.com/skywatcher-102mm-maksutov-cassegrain-telescope-ota-s11510). As things go, it was pretty cloudy and I did not read any instructions on how to properly align, etc. So not the most productive day, but I did observe some of the some-functional tracking, allowing me to keep Jupiter in sight for a lot longer. Below is a picture of Jupiter in Monochrome.
