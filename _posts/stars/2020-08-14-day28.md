Today we got some clear skies and it was time to rock and roll. I admit, at no point did we really ever truly align the tracking mount... that is something we will need to do if we want to actually use this mount correctly. However, we did spend a lot of time imaging Jupiter, which tbh you don't necessarilly need a tracker for since the exposure is so short. First we took a stab at trying to get the tracker going with just my brother's camera... not much success here since we had not guider. Then we tried my brother's camera through the telescope. Again not too much luck since his camera's live view is limited and it was extremely hard to focus. However, once I got my ZWO ASI120MM-S in there things really popped! Following my usual processing pattern with LRGB filters, I captured the following picture of Jupiter, followed by a monochrome of Saturn just for fun before packing up (and failing to get anything of M-45 without the tracking working).

My brother also got this sweet picture of me:
