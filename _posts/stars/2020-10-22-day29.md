Wow it has been a long time since I last observed. I did try to catch Mars at its opposition last week but was clouded out. After a couple weeks of my mom telling me it's time to get the telescope back out (and nearly two whole months of smoke covered skies) I finally got out... turns out if you wait long enough it's almost like a brand new sky. Finally got to see Orion's Nebula and it certainly lived up to the hype. After taking a little bit more time with my tracking mount, I even almst got it working correctly - for the picture of Mars, Mars was almost still Unfortunately my phone died (the phone controls the tracker) and so I couldn't really test out to see if I could capture M42.
