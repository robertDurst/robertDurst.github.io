# I am Now Officially an Open Source Contributor

One of the coolest things about the blockchain/crypto craze in my opinion is the wealth of amazing open source projects. A goal of mine for a while has been to contribute to one of these projects, a sort of rite of passage in the crypto dev community. Well, I have finally made my first contribution!

The project I chose to contribute to is [StellarTerm](https://stellarterm.com/), a Stellar Trading Client. I chose to address the need for a minimal, yet informational account history table. Here is what I came up with:

You can even hover over the assets to get a cool little popup (I did not design the popup):

And you can filter by effect (action) type:

Quite exciting stuff! If you're also an open source contributor to a cool crypto project, please feel free to comment below.
