I spent the last three and a half months reading through [Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=2ahUKEwii-u6fp43kAhW4FTQIHbsGB0MQFjADegQIABAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCompilers%3A_Principles%2C_Techniques%2C_and_Tools&usg=AOvVaw3164Na6eLEcEJLdOc1a1f4) and implementing my own programming languages, [Sailfish](https://github.com/sailfish-lang). As part of the final submission for my project to complete this independent study, I wrote a manual for the language, describing how it works, and some of the design processes along the way.
