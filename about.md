Welcome to my corner of the internet.

## About Me

I am a Software Engineer on the Platform team at DocuSign. Just recently I graduated remotely from Colby College with a **computer science major** and **mathematics minor**. Recently, I've taken on a few interesting programming endeavors including creating my own programming language -- the slightly less than functional [Sailfish Programming Language](https://github.com/sailfish-lang/sailfishc) -- and attempting to sell [Ice Cream for Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-lightning-risky-maybe-ice-cream-will-tempt). When afk, you can find me cruising roads with my brother [looking for snakes](https://robbob77.github.io/) or surfing the local break at Pacifica.
